# Python-Assignments
Python project
In my main branch, I have 4 task files, task1, task2, task3 and task4 file for Assignment 1_data_structures_assignment.

Task 1 file will run the below 4 subtasks, I have commented the same in the code cells:

#1.Create a list named products containing at least 6 product names (strings).
#2. Create a tuple named sample_product that stores (product_name, price,category) for one product.
#3.print 2nd and last product from the products list
#4.Append two new product names to products and then print the updated list

Task 2 file will run the below 3 subtasks, I have commented the same in the code cells:

#1. From your products list, create a set of categories called categories_set. (If product
names do not contain categories, create a short parallel list categories = [..] with
matching length and use that.)
#2. Demonstrate adding a new category to the set and show that duplicates are ignored.
#3. Show how to check whether a category exists in the set (print a boolean result)

Task 3 file will run the below 3 subtasks, I have commented the same in the code cells:

#1. Create a dictionary price_dict where keys are product names and values are prices (integers or floats). Include at least 6 entries.
#2. Write small code blocks to:Add a new product with price to price_dict. Update the price of an existing product.Remove a product by name (handle the case when the product does not exist).
#3. Print the average price of all products (use only dictionary operations and basic arithmetic).

Task 4 file will run the below 3 subtasks, I have commented the same in the code cells:

#1. Using the products list and price_dict, create a list of tuples named catalog where each tuple is (product_name, price, category).
#2. From catalog, create a new dictionary category_to_products that maps each category to a list of product names in that category.
#3. Print all products that belong to the category that has the maximum number of Products.
